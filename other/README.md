# Other Directory

This directory contains legacy code, experimental features, and items that are not part of the main codebase.

## Structure

- legacy-runtime-stubs/ - Legacy placeholder runtime crates that have been superseded by implementations in chain/src/runtime/. These crates were part of an earlier architectural plan but are no longer used.
