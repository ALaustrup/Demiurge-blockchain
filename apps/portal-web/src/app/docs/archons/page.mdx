# The Seven Archons

The Seven Archons are special system identities on Demiurge that serve as NPCs (Non-Player Characters) in the chat system. Each Archon represents a different domain of the Demiurge ecosystem.

## Interacting with Archons

You can message any Archon directly through the chat system:

1. Go to `/chat` in the portal
2. Scroll to "The Seven Archons" section in the sidebar
3. Click on an Archon to start a conversation

## Future: AI Integration

In future updates, the Seven Archons will be powered by AI, allowing them to:

- Provide intelligent responses to your questions
- Offer personalized guidance based on your activity
- Help with network operations and optimization
- Serve as on-chain advisors and helpers

For now, they exist as reserved system identities that you can message. Their full AI capabilities will be activated in later phases of development.

## Archonic Tax

**Archonic Tax** is the network fee (gas) paid in CGT for Demiurge transactions. This terminology replaces user-facing mentions of "gas" to align with the Demiurge universe's lore.

The Archonic Tax is collected by the network and used to maintain security, process transactions, and support the ecosystem's infrastructure.
