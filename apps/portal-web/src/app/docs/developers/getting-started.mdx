# Developer Guide: Getting Started

Welcome to the Demiurge Developer Platform. This guide will help you get started building on Demiurge.

## What is the Developer Registry?

The Developer Registry is an on-chain and off-chain system for tracking developers and their projects on Demiurge. It provides:

- **Developer Profiles**: Public profiles with username, reputation, and project listings
- **Project Management**: Register and manage your projects
- **Reputation System**: Build your reputation through contributions (coming soon)
- **Discovery**: Find other developers and projects

## How to Register

### Prerequisites

1. **Create an UrgeID**: You need an UrgeID with a claimed username
   - Go to `/urgeid` in the Portal
   - Generate or load your UrgeID
   - Claim a username (if not already claimed)

2. **Ensure you're logged in**: Your address must be stored in localStorage

### Registration Steps

1. Navigate to `/developers` in the Portal
2. Click "Become a Developer"
3. Your UrgeID username will be used for your developer profile
4. Registration happens both on-chain (via RPC) and off-chain (GraphQL cache)

### Via CLI

```bash
demiurge dev register --username myusername --address 0x...
```

Note: CLI registration currently requires proper transaction signing. Use the Portal UI for the best experience.

## How to Claim Your Username

Your developer username must match your UrgeID username:

1. Go to `/urgeid`
2. If you don't have a username, claim one using the "Set Username" feature
3. Your username must be:
   - 3-32 characters
   - Lowercase alphanumeric + underscore only
   - Unique across all UrgeIDs

## How to Add Projects

### Via Portal

1. Go to `/developers/projects`
2. Click "Create Project"
3. Fill in:
   - **Slug**: URL-friendly identifier (e.g., `my-awesome-project`)
   - **Name**: Display name (e.g., "My Awesome Project")
   - **Description**: Optional project description
4. Click "Create"

You'll automatically be added as a maintainer.

### Via CLI

```bash
demiurge dev add-project --slug my-project --name "My Project" --description "Description here"
```

## How Reputation Will Be Used

Reputation is a future feature that will track:

- Contributions to core protocol
- Popular projects
- Community engagement
- Code contributions
- Documentation improvements

For now, reputation starts at 0 and will be incremented as the system evolves.

## Next Steps

- [SDK Documentation](/docs/developers/sdk-ts) - Learn to use the TypeScript SDK
- [Templates](/docs/developers/templates) - Get started with project templates
- [Rust SDK](/docs/developers/sdk-rust) - Use the Rust SDK for server-side development
