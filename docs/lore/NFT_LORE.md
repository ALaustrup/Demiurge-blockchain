# D-GEN NFTs - Digital Genesis

*"In the Abyss, every creation is a world. Every NFT is a universe."*

## The D-GEN Standard

D-GEN (Digital Genesis) NFTs are not mere tokens. They are:
- **Art**: Visual creations, music, poetry
- **Worlds**: Virtual spaces, games, experiences
- **Code**: Modules, plugins, tools
- **Identity**: Badges, achievements, proof of existence

## The Fabric Connection

Every D-GEN NFT can link to Fabric content—the P2P network where actual files live. The NFT is the on-chain proof; Fabric is the decentralized storage.

## The Royalties

Creators set royalties (in basis points). Every sale automatically routes a portion to the creator. This is not optional—it is fundamental to the economy.

## The Philosophy

*"An NFT is not a receipt. It is a claim. A claim to a piece of the Abyss. A claim to a moment of creation. A claim to existence itself."*
