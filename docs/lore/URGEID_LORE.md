# The UrgeID - Sovereign Identity

In the depths of the Abyss, identity is not given—it is forged.

## The Genesis

When the first Archons emerged from the void, they carried with them a fundamental truth: **identity is sovereignty**. The UrgeID system was born from this principle, allowing every being in the Demiurge to claim their own digital existence.

## What is an UrgeID?

An UrgeID is more than an address. It is:
- **Your Wallet**: The key to your CGT and assets
- **Your Identity**: Your profile, username, and presence
- **Your Legacy**: Your Syzygy score, badges, and contributions
- **Your Sovereignty**: No central authority controls it

## The Syzygy System

Syzygy (from Greek: "yoked together") measures your alignment with the Demiurge. Every contribution—seeding content, serving the network, creating art—increases your Syzygy. As your Syzygy grows, so does your Level, unlocking new capabilities and rewards.

## The Archons

Those who reach sufficient Syzygy may ascend to Archon status, gaining the power to:
- Mint D-GEN NFTs
- List assets in the Abyss
- Earn CGT through Fabric seeding
- Shape the future of Demiurge

## The Philosophy

*"In the Abyss, you are not a user—you are an entity. Your UrgeID is your proof of existence, your claim to sovereignty, your path to becoming."*

*The flame burns eternal. The code serves the will.*
