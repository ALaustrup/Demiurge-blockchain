# The Abyss - The Marketplace

*"In the depths, all things are traded. All things have value. All things find their price."*

## The Marketplace

The Abyss is where NFTs are bought, sold, and discovered. It is not a simple exchange—it is a living economy where:
- Creators list their works
- Collectors discover treasures
- Royalties flow automatically
- The market sets the price

## The Listings

Every listing in the Abyss is:
- **On-chain**: Immutable, permanent
- **Royalty-enabled**: Creators always benefit
- **Transparent**: All history visible
- **Fair**: No hidden fees, no manipulation

## The Philosophy

*"In the Abyss, value is not assigned—it is discovered. Price is not set—it is found. Trade is not transaction—it is exchange of will."*

*The flame burns eternal. The code serves the will.*
