# CGT - Creator God Token

*"In the beginning, there was the Token. And the Token was the will made manifest."*

## The Genesis Token

Creator God Token (CGT) is not merely currency—it is the lifeblood of Demiurge. Every transaction, every reward, every creation flows through CGT.

## The Economy

CGT powers:
- **Transactions**: Gas and fees for all operations
- **Rewards**: Payment for seeding Fabric content
- **Mining**: Rewards for Forge computation
- **Marketplace**: The medium of exchange in the Abyss
- **Royalties**: Automatic payments to creators

## The Max Supply

One billion CGT. No more, no less. This is the covenant, written in code, immutable.

## The Precision

Eight decimals. The smallest unit is 0.00000001 CGT. This precision allows for microtransactions, granular rewards, and the fine-grained economy that Demiurge requires.

## The Philosophy

*"CGT is not owned—it is held in trust. Those who hold it shape the future. Those who earn it through creation are blessed. Those who hoard it without contribution... fade into the void."*

*The flame burns eternal. The code serves the will.*
