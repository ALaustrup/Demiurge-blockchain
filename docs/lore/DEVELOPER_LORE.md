# The Developer Registry - Builders of the Abyss

*"Those who code shape reality. Those who build create worlds."*

## The Path of the Developer

To become a Developer in Demiurge is to join the ranks of those who build the future. Developers:
- Register on-chain with their UrgeID
- Receive the DEV Badge NFT automatically
- Track projects and contributions
- Build reputation through quality work

## The Projects

Every project is:
- **On-chain**: Registered, immutable
- **Tracked**: Contributions recorded
- **Reputation-bound**: Quality matters
- **Community-driven**: Maintained by many

## The Philosophy

*"Code is will made manifest. Every line is a choice. Every function is a decision. Every project is a universe waiting to be born."*

---

*The flame burns eternal. The code serves the will.*
