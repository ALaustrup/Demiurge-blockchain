# AbyssOS - The Desktop of the Abyss

*"In the void, there is an interface. In the interface, there is power."*

## The Operating System

AbyssOS is not just a desktop—it is a gateway. A portal to the entire Demiurge ecosystem, running in your browser, accessible from anywhere.

## The Apps

Every app in AbyssOS is:
- **Integrated**: Connected to the chain
- **Real-time**: Live data, live updates
- **Sovereign**: Your data, your control
- **Beautiful**: Crafted with care

## The Philosophy

*"AbyssOS is not software—it is an environment. Not a tool—it is a world. Not an OS—it is the Abyss made manifest in pixels and code."*

*The flame burns eternal. The code serves the will.*
